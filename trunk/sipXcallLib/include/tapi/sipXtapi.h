/**
 * Place the specified call on hold.  When placing calls on hold or
 * having a remote party place you on hold the event sequences will
 * differ.  In this documentation, we refer to "local" hold and/or 
 * "focus" and "remote" and/or "full" hold.  A call is on local hold 
 * when that call is taken out of focus and is no longer connected to
 * the local microphone and speaker.  Remote hold is used to indicate 
 * that RTP is no longer flowing between parties.  The "bRemoteStopAudio" 
 * flags to this method controls whether the party is placed on local 
 * hold or full hold.  See the table below for expected events:
 *
 *<pre>
 *                   RTP Flowing  RTP Stopped
 *                   ---------    -----------
 *       In Focus    CONNECTED    REMOTE_HELD
 *   Out of Focus     BRIDGED        HELD
 *</pre>
 *
 * CONNECTED indicates that both RTP is flowing and the call is attached
 *    to the local.  This is the normal state for a connected call.
 *
 * BRIDGED indicates that RTP is flowing, but the call is out of focus.
 *    This event is generally caused by holding a conference (conference 
 *    will bridge by default) or if you accept/place a new call without
 *    explicitly holding the active call.
 *
 * REMOTE_HELD indicates that RTP has stopped flowing.  This is generally
 *    caused when the remote side places you on hold.  The call is still
 *    locally in focus and audio will automatically resume once your are 
 *    take off remote hold.
 *
 * HELD indicates that both RTP has stopped flowing and the call is out
 *    of focus.
 *
 * Developers can also expect media events (e.g. MEDIA_LOCAL_STOP) 
 * whenever RTP is stopped (REMOTE_HELD and HELD).  Since media is still 
 * flowing for CONNECTED and BRIDGED, no media stop events are sent.

 * Blind transfer the specified call to another party using REFER (rfc3515).
 * Monitor the TRANSFER state events for details on the transfer attempt.
 *
 * There are three parties involved in blind transfer:

 * 2.) Transferee - receives REFER request, accepts or rejects it, creates
 *     new call and drops original call automatically.
 * 3.) Transfer target - receives INVITE request from transferee
 *
 * Received event sequence depends on whether transferee supports sending NOTIFY
 * requests to transfer controller for the duration of call transfer. If NOTIFY
 * is not supported by transferee, then some transfer events will be missing.
 *
 * SIP message flow of unattended transfer can be seen
 * on http://www.tech-invite.com/Ti-sip-service-4.html .
 *

 * Original Call: MEDIA_LOCAL_STOP
 * Original Call: MEDIA_REMOTE_STOP

 * by sipXtapi.
